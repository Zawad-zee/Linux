 Learning Linux- file administration, shell scripting and more 

 With the advent of machines, human beings have become lazy. And with AI has made us even more lazier, we do not put effort or time to research like we used to before even writing a post like this one :P. We stopped reading books and easy way out is to take the help of the machines/tools. AI has become so advanced that you do not even need to know programming or scripting, it can do the work all it requires is a prompt. Scary part is in future there could be a workforce who will not be skilled enough to troubleshoot the tools. We need to be independent of these machines and not be dependent fully but rely on them for efficiency. So I took advantage of using the AI tools (Gemini/chatgpt) for quite sometime now to list out the skills required for certain tools and then design a schedule to master these tools. Thought of sharing with you all and so that you can benefit as well as I go through the journey of learning and acquiring new skills. Starting off with Linux/Scripting as I am aiming to get into CyberSec role if Allah(God) wills.
